## üèóÔ∏è System Design for AI Engineering

When designing AI systems, these are key system design patterns and components to consider:

- **Model Serving Infrastructure:** Design for high availability, low latency (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, custom API).
- **Vector Databases for Embeddings:** Use tools like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus for semantic search.
- **Inference Optimisation:** Quantisation, pruning, distillation for faster inference.
- **Feature Store:** A central repository for storing and sharing ML features (e.g., Feast, Tecton).
- **Batch vs Real-time Inference:** Trade-offs between latency and throughput.
- **Monitoring and Feedback Loop:** Continuous model monitoring, drift detection, and feedback for improvement.

## üì¶ LLM Deployment Patterns

Common patterns for deploying large language models effectively:

- **API-as-a-Service:** Wrap your LLM as a REST/gRPC API and deploy using cloud services or Kubernetes.
- **Edge Deployment:** Run small or quantised models on edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices).
- **Hybrid Cloud + Edge:** Serve large models from the cloud and lightweight components on-device.
- **Multi-Tenant Serving:** Serve multiple models or versions using a shared infrastructure (e.g., using Seldon or KServe).
- **Sharded Serving:** Split large models across multiple nodes for parallel inference.
- **Serverless LLM Inference:** Use serverless platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda + Hugging Face) for cost-efficient scaling.

## üöÄ Productionisation of AI Systems

Things to consider when moving AI systems from prototype to production:

- **Model Versioning and CI/CD:** Use tools like MLflow, DVC, or Weights & Biases for model tracking and deployment automation.
- **Latency and Throughput:** Design APIs and infra for SLA adherence.
- **Scalability:** Use autoscaling and load balancing (e.g., K8s, AWS SageMaker) for inference endpoints.
- **Monitoring:** Set up metrics for input data drift, model performance degradation, and alerting.
- **Data Privacy and Security:** Implement encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control.
- **A/B Testing and Shadow Deployment:** Safely roll out new models and gather feedback.
